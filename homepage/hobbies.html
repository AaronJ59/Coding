          I believe that my hobbies are a large part of my identity. If I really evaluate my life, I could say I have multiple hobbies but I'll stick with the two that I do the most.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Playing the drums has made the top two. I have been doing it since I was 13, and I'd like to think that I have been fairly consistent with it. Initially, I really did not<br>
          enjoy playing the drums since my father put me into drum lessons against my will. I didn't like the thought of having to learn something entirely new. But as time passed<br>
          and after many lessons, I ended up enjoying it. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I joined my church's band. Music has been such a nice past-time for me, and I don't<br>
          wish for it to have gone any other way.

        <p>
          Weighlifting is the other largest hobby in my life. When I was 16, my weight leaned to the overweight side for my age and size group. That same year, my father put me in<br>
          the gym. As time passed, I grew to love it, and the gym has been a consistent part of my life ever since.
