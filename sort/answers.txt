sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It takes incredibly long to sort a reversed50000.txt.
                  It's using the upper bound of O(n^2), which is the longest.
                  A reversed set of ordered numbers is the worst case scenario for bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Seems to be fast in all the txt files. This 'sort' file
                  corresponds to the lower bound and upper bound being
                  (n log n) which is one of the faster algorithms.


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It takes longer than the other 'sort' files. This is the case
                  for all of the txt files, whether it be sorted, reversed, or random.
                  Selection Sort has (n^2) as both the upper bound and lower bound and (n^2) is the slowest.
